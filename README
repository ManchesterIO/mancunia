This is the site for the mancunia.mobi spin of Molly

Getting Started
---------------

1. If you have any site specific configuration, you can put that in
   settings_local.py and then this will be imported at the end of the regular
   settings.py, therefore overriding any existing settings.py that exists.

2. Add your API keys to local_secrets.py:

    LDB = 'National Rail API'
    CLOUDMADE = ''
    SENTRY = 'DSN for sentry'
    GOOGLE_ANALYTICS = ''
    SECRET_KEY = 'random string for Django'

3. Install the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. python manage.py deploy
